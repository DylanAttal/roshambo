### Summary

This project was one of my first experiences coding an app with Javascript. The overall goal of the Roshambo (why is it called [Roshambo](https://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/23932)?) project is to make a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. I'm proud of using the `:hover` CSS pseudo-class and `classList.add()` to style the buttons. This was my first time using `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` to select a random value from an array--in this case, the computer choice.
